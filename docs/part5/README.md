# Part 5

Your task for this last part is to
- Choose a suitable battery to power your ESP8266 (you do not need to actually wire the battery to your circuit)
- Modify the software you have built so far, to:
  - Increase as much as possible the battery life for your device, with minimum impact to the application, and 
  - Estimate residual battery lifetime, and send a notification (e.g. via e-mail) to give someone enough time to replace the batteries before the device dies down

## Hints

- Investigate all available sleeping modes for the ESP8266 and for all the components of your application
